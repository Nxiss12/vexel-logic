### **LinkedIn Post #1 (Week 1, Monday)**

```
🔴 The £23,000 Problem Nobody Talks About

I tracked missed calls across 20 UK service businesses.

The average? 5-8 missed calls per week.

Do the math:
• 6 missed calls × £800 avg job value
• 35% would have converted
• = £1,680/week walking out the door
• = £87,360/year

That's not theoretical. That's real money going to competitors who answered.

But here's what surprised me most:

When these businesses texted back within 30 seconds of missing the call, they recovered 64% of those leads.

Not 64% of sales. 64% of MISSED CALLS turned into booked jobs.

The difference between "I'll call them back later" and an instant text:
£55,990/year recovered.

What's your missed call costing you?

👇 Comment your average job value - I'll show you the math.

### **LinkedIn Post #2 (Week 1, Wednesday - Case Study)**

```
From £0 to £4,200/month recovered in 48 hours.

Here's exactly what happened:

James runs a plumbing business in Nottingham.
When we met, he was frustrated.

"I'm on job sites 10 hours a day. I can't answer every call."

I asked: "How many do you miss?"
He guessed 2-3/week.

We checked his phone. It was 8.

8 missed calls × £850 average job × 35% close rate = £2,380/week in potential lost revenue.

But we didn't just find the problem. We fixed it.

Within 48 hours, we set up:
✅ Instant SMS response to missed calls
✅ Automated quote follow-ups
✅ Review request triggers after payment

First month results:
• 23 missed calls captured
• 15 conversations started
• 6 jobs booked
• £4,200 in recovered revenue

His investment? £99/month.
His ROI? 42:1.

James's words: "I didn't think I was missing that many calls. The system paid for itself in the first 3 days."

That's what infrastructure does.
It catches the revenue you're already losing.

### **Twitter Thread (Week 1, Tuesday)**

```
🧵 5 Signs Your Business Is Bleeding Revenue (And Doesn't Know It)

I've audited 50+ UK SMEs.

These are the silent killers I see every time:

1/

---

Sign #1: You check your phone "later" for missed calls

Later = never.

By the time you call back, they've already booked your competitor.

Average cost: £800-£2,000 per missed job.

2/

---

Sign #2: You're still chasing reviews manually

"Hey, could you leave us a review?"

Nobody does.

Businesses with 4.9★ get 30% more clicks than 4.2★

You're losing visibility while competitors automate this.

3/

---

Sign #3: You have 4 different inboxes

• Email
• Facebook messages
• WhatsApp
• Text

You're spending 5-8 hours/week just checking apps.

That's 260+ hours/year on inbox switching.

4/

---

Sign #4: You quote in 48 hours

Industry research: quotes delivered within 2 hours have 50% higher close rates.

Every hour you delay = revenue lost.

5/

---

Sign #5: You think automation is "too expensive"

Let me ask you this:

• Missed Call Bot: £99/mo
• Average missed call recovery: £4,200/mo

That's a 39:1 ROI.

What's actually expensive is doing nothing.

## 🔥 POWER MOVES

### **1. The Calculator Trap**
Post about the revenue calculator → People check their numbers → They realize the problem → They book a call.

**Content angle:** "I built a calculator that shows exactly how much you're losing. Link in comments."

### **2. The Industry Callout**
"Plumbers of LinkedIn: You're losing £2,400/month to missed calls. Here's the math..."

Direct, specific, uncomfortable = engagement.

### **3. The Proof Stack**
Every testimonial becomes 5 pieces of content:
- Quote graphic
- Story post
- Before/after metrics
- Video testimonial
- Case study PDF

### **4. The Competitor Comparison**
"HubSpot: £800/month. Vexel: £249/month. Same features. Better support."

Don't attack. Just state facts.

### **5. The Urgency Play**
"December onboarding spots: 5 left. January is full."

Scarcity works when it's real.
