# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Copy and Run This

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI if you don't have it
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel (will open browser)
vercel login

# Deploy from the landing-page folder
cd landing-page
vercel --prod

# When prompted:
# - Link to existing project? YES
# - Select: vexel-logic-xa9l
```

This will deploy your new service-based page to:
- https://vexel-logic-xa9l.vercel.app

Then you can connect your custom domain `vexellogic.com` in the Vercel dashboard!

---

**OR** if you want me to create a completely NEW Vercel deployment, I can guide you through that too. Just tell me which you prefer:

A) Update the existing vexel-logic-xa9l project
B) Create a brand new Vercel project
C) You'll log into Vercel web and do it manually

What would you like to do?
