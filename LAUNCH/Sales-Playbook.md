## What to Say

### LinkedIn Connection Request

```
Hi [Name],

Saw [Company] is growing in [location]. 

Quick question: how much revenue do you think you lose 
to missed calls each month?

Most [industry] businesses lose £1-2k/month. We automated 
the follow-up process.

Worth a look?

Benedict
```

### Email Subject Lines

**High open rates:**
- "Quick question about [Company]"
- "[Name], losing leads to missed calls?"
- "£15k recovery opportunity for [Company]"
- "2-minute read for [Name]"

---

### Discovery Questions (Demo Start)

Ask these in first 5 minutes:

1. "How many customer inquiries do you get per week?"
2. "How many do you think you miss?"
3. "What's your average job/project value?"
4. "What happens when you miss a call right now?"
5. "Have you tried any automation before? What happened?"

*(Take notes - use for calculator)*

---

## Pricing Conversations

### Presenting Price

**WRONG:** "It costs £249 per month."

**RIGHT:** "You're losing £23k per year to missed calls. This costs £2,988 per year. If it recovers just 15% of that, you make £500/month extra. Pay for itself 4x over."

### Three Pricing Tiers

| Plan | Price | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Growth** | £249/mo | Trades, small service businesses |
| **Professional** | £697/mo | Healthcare, legal, consultants |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | 50+ employees, complex needs |

**When to offer what:**

- **Owen (tradesperson)** → Growth (£249/mo)
- **Sarah (healthcare)** → Professional (£697/mo)
- **Corporate** → Enterprise (custom)

---

## Handling Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand. Let me ask - what's one new customer worth to you?"

*(They say £800)*

"So if this tool recovers just 3 customers per month, that's £2,400. Cost is £249. You're up £2,151 per month. Does that math work for you?"

---

### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course! What specifically would you like to think about?"

*(Listen to their actual concern, address it directly)*

"How about this - we offer a 7-day trial. Zero risk. You can cancel anytime. Want to just try it?"

---

### "We're too busy right now"

**Response:**
"That's actually the perfect time. You're too busy, which means you're definitely missing calls and opportunities.

This system runs on autopilot. Setup is 48 hours on our end. You spend 30 minutes total. Then it just works."

---

### "Can I just build this myself?"

**Response:**
"You absolutely could. Here's what's involved:
- Twilio account + API setup
- SMS automation rules
- CRM integration
- GDPR compliance configuration
- Testing and maintenance

Most businesses spend 80-120 hours building something like this. At your hourly rate, that's £4,000-£6,000 in time. Plus ongoing maintenance.

We charge £2,988 per year and handle everything. Including updates, support, and compliance."

---

### "I need to talk to my partner/accountant"

**Response:**
"Smart move. What numbers do they need to see to say yes?"

*(Get specific criteria)*

"I'll send you a one-page ROI breakdown with those numbers. When are you meeting with them?"

*(Get commitment)*

- Build rapport

**Minutes 5-15: Show Their Numbers**

- Make it personal to them

**Minutes 15-25: Solution Demo**

  1. Missed Call Bot (everyone needs this)

## Closing Tactics

### 1. Trial Close

"Want to test it for 7 days? If it doesn't work, cancel anytime. Zero risk."

---

### 2. Urgency (Use Sparingly)

"I have 2 setup slots available this week. After that, it's a 2-week wait. Want one of these slots?"

---

### 3. Guarantee

"30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't recover at least £500 in value in the first month, I'll refund you 100%. Plus, you keep any revenue you made. Fair?"

---

### 4. Down-sell (If They Won't Budge)

"Tell you what - let's start with just the Missed Call Bot. That's £149/month. Get comfortable with it. Add more tools later if you want."

---

## After the Demo

### If They Say Yes:

1. **Send contract immediately** (while they're excited)
2. **Schedule setup call** (within 48 hours)
3. **Send welcome email** with next steps
4. See: [OPERATIONS/Customer-Onboarding.md](../OPERATIONS/Customer-Onboarding.md)

Any questions?"

**Day 3:**
"[Name], have you had a chance to review? Happy to answer any questions."

**Day 7:**
"[Name], I'm closing out this week's onboarding slots. Still interested in testing this?"

**Day 14 (last attempt):**

## Pricing Negotiation

### When to Discount

**Do NOT discount** in first conversation. Hold firm.

**Consider discounting if:**
- They're committing to annual (offer 20% off)
- They're referring 2+ customers (offer 1 month free)
- They're a strategic account (healthcare, legal - good case study potential)

**Maximum discount:** 30% off first year only

---

### Annual Contracts

**Offer:**
"Pay annually, save 20%."

**Math:**
- Monthly: £249 × 12 = £2,988
- Annual: £2,390 (save £598)

**Why do this:**
- Lower churn (locked in for year)
- Better cash flow (money upfront)
- Demonstrates commitment

---

## Success Metrics

**Track these numbers weekly:**

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Prospects contacted | 30/week | __ |
| Conversations started | 10/week | __ |
| Demos booked | 3/week | __ |
| Demos completed | 3/week | __ |
| Customers closed | 1/week | __ |
| Close rate | 30% | __% |

**Close rate calculation:**
(Customers closed ÷ Demos completed) × 100

**Example:** 1 customer / 3 demos = 33% close rate ✅

---

## Quick Tips

1. **Listen more than you talk** - 70/30 rule
2. **Use their language** - If they say "clients", don't say "customers"
3. **Tell stories** - "We had a plumber who recovered £12k in 6 weeks..."
4. **Be confident** - You have a great product
5. **Qualify hard** - Don't waste time on bad fits
6. **Follow up relentlessly** - 80% of sales happen after 5+ touchpoints

---

## Red Flags (Bad Fit Customers)

**Don't sell to:**
- Businesses doing <£200k/year (can't afford it)
- Companies with <5 inquiries/week (not enough volume)
- People who haggle aggressively on price (will churn)
- Businesses that don't answer their phone during demo (ironic)

**Remember:** You're not selling software. You're selling recovered revenue and saved time.

Every "no" gets you closer to a "yes". Keep going! 🚀
