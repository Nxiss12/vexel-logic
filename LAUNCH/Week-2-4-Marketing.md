## Week 3: Start Conversations

### LinkedIn Connection Strategy

**Daily goal:** 10 connection requests

**Message template:**

```
Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] is doing well in [location]. 

Many businesses at your stage lose £20k+ per year to missed calls and slow follow-ups.

We built a system that texts customers back in <30 seconds. It's UK-specific and GDPR-compliant.

Worth a quick look?

Best,
Benedict
```

**Key rules:**
- Personalize first line (check their profile/company)
- Keep it under 300 characters
- No hard sell - just curiosity
- Send Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm only

### Follow-Up Sequence

**If they accept:**

**Day 1:** Thank them for connecting
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]! 

How are you currently handling missed calls at [Company]?
```

**Day 3:** Share value (if they respond)
```
Most [industry] businesses we work with were losing £1-2k/month 
to missed opportunities. 

We automated their follow-up. Happy to show you how - takes 15 min.

Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]
```

**Day 7:** Soft close (if no response)
```
[Name], quick question:

If I could show you how to recover £15-20k in lost revenue 
(in 15 minutes), would you be interested?

No pressure - just thought it might be relevant.
```

### Email Outreach (If You Have Emails)

**Subject lines that work:**
- "Quick question about [Company]"
- "[Name], losing leads to missed calls?"
- "15-minute audit for [Company]?"

**Email template:**

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is growing fast in [location].

Quick question: how many customer calls do you miss per week?

Most [industry] businesses we work with were losing £1,500-£2,000 
per month to unanswered inquiries.

We built an automated system that texts back missed calls in <30 seconds.
Setup takes 48 hours. GDPR-compliant. UK-based support.

Worth a 15-minute look? You can book here: [Calendly]

Best,
Benedict Anokye-Davies
Vexel Logic
[Your phone]
```

**Goal by end of Week 3:**
- 30 connection requests sent
- 10-15 accepted connections
- 2-3 demo calls booked

---

## Week 4: Book & Close Demos

### Demo Preparation

**Before the call:**
1. Research their business (5 minutes)
2. Check their website for pain points
3. Look at their reviews on Google
4. Prepare their personalized calculator

**Demo tools to show:**
1. Missed Call Bot (everyone wants this)
2. Review Engine (if they have <50 Google reviews)
3. Unified Inbox (if they mention "too many platforms")

### Demo Structure (30 Minutes)

**Minutes 0-5: Discovery**

"Before I show you anything, help me understand:
- How many customer inquiries do you get per week?
- How many do you think you miss?
- What's your average job value?"

*(Take notes - you'll use this for calculator)*

**Minutes 5-15: Show Their Numbers**

Pull up the calculator on your website:

"Based on what you told me:
- You get ~100 calls/week
- Miss ~15% (industry average)
- Average job: £800

That's 12 missed calls × £800 × 52 weeks = **£499k in lost opportunity per year**

For you, it's probably 20-30% you're actually losing. So roughly **£100-150k**."

**Minutes 15-25: Show the Solution**

Screen share your live website:
1. Show Missed Call Bot in action (demo mode)
2. Show Review Engine interface
3. Show Unified Inbox

"This is what happens:
1. Customer calls, you don't answer
2. Within 30 seconds: automatic SMS sent
3. They reply → goes to your Unified Inbox
4. You respond when convenient
5. Review request sent automatically after job"

**Minutes 25-30: Close**

"Two questions:
1. Does this solve your missed call problem?
2. Want to stop losing these leads?"

*(Wait for their response)*

"Great. We can have you live by Friday. It's £249/month - basically 3-4 recovered jobs pays for it.

I'll send you a link after this call. Any questions?"

### Handling Objections

**"It's too expensive"**
- "I understand. Let me ask: how much is one new customer worth to you?"
- *(They say £800)*
- "So if this recovers just 1 extra job per month, you're up £9.6k per year. Cost is £2,988. That's a 3:1 return."

**"I need to think about it"**
- "Of course. What specifically would you like to think about?"
- *(Address their actual concern)*
- "Tell you what - we offer a 7-day trial. Zero risk. If it doesn't work, cancel anytime."

**"We're too busy right now"**
- "That's exactly why you need this - you're missing opportunities because you're busy."
- "Setup takes 48 hours on our end. You spend 30 minutes. Then it runs automatically."

### Closing Tactics

**Option 1: Trial Close**
"Want to test it for a week? You can always cancel."

**Option 2: Urgency**
"I have 2 setup slots left this week. Want one?"

**Option 3: Guarantee**
"30-day money-back guarantee. If you don't recover at least £500 in value, full refund."

**Goal by end of Week 4:**
- 3 demos completed
- 1 customer closed (at minimum)
- 2 follow-ups scheduled
