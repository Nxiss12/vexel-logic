## 🤝 Sales & Outreach

### Cold Email #1: Initial Contact

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company]

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] is growing in [location]. Quick question: how much revenue do you think you lose to missed customer calls each month?

Most [industry] businesses we work with were losing £1,500-£2,000/month to unanswered inquiries.

We built an automated system that texts back missed calls in <30 seconds. Setup takes 48 hours. GDPR-compliant. UK-based support.

Worth a 15-minute look? You can book here: [Calendly link]
