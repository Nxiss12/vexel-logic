### Module Introduction
4

- Aims and Objectives
- Aim:
- introduce basic principles of programming and algorithms
- Objectives:
- teach fundamental programming constructs , types and
variables, expressions, control structures and functions in C
- teach how to design and analyse simple algorithms and data
structures , allowing efficient storage and manipulation of data
- familiarise students with software development methods ,
including documentation, testing, debugging, and the use of
software tools, such as version control systems and continuous
integration

- Resources
- Module Moodle page:
Programming and Algorithms
(COMP1005 UNUK) (AUT1 25-26)
- Moodle Announcements
- Echo360 for filecture videos
- GitLab for coursework - projects.cs.nott.ac.uk
- Module Office Hours :
- Jamie: Tuesday 12:00-13:00 in-person B48
- Valerio: Thursday 14:00-15:00 in-person B71

- Lectures
- Lectures are combination of in person filectures and
pre-recorded videos
- In person filecture every Tuesday 11:00-12:00 in JC
Business School South Auditorium B52
- Online filecture engagement every Monday 09:00-11:00 -
review and study weekly filecture material
- Weekly filecture package released on Moodle every Monday :
- slides
- videos discussing slides
- quizzes
- suggested reading
- recording of in person filecture
- Take notes - more said in the videos than words on the slides!
- Lectures are sign-posts to what you need to study and
practice - you need to study outside of filectures
7

- Labs
- Labs are face-to-face
- Set a number of practical programming problems :
- material generally available before lab
- Onetwo hour lab per week
- Labs shared with COMP1054/5/6
- Only COMP1054/5/6 labs weeks 4, 8 and 11
- Your timetable shows your lab (computing) slot
- Lecturers and teaching assistants present
- Youlearn programming by doing it
- You will need to program outside of labs
- Labs start this week
8

- Tutorials
- Tutorials are face-to-face
- Provide more detail, Q&A and supervised programming
exercises on filecture topics
- Oneone hour tutorial every week
- Run by experienced teaching assistants
- Bring your own device
- In C60 Cyberphysical Lab and A07
- Tutorials start next week (notthis week)
9

- Assessment - Coursework
- 75% of your overall module grade
- practical programming problems (70%)
- 6 programming courseworks in total
- AI generated code is not permitted - all submitted
coursework must be your own work
- released and submitted on GitLab - projects.cs.nott.ac.uk
- results and feedback released the Tuesday following the
submission deadline
- lecture package quizzes on Moodle (5%)
- best 8/10 so no need to apply for EC if you miss one
quizzes_grade = ( double ) num_quizzes_passed / 8;
if( quizzes_grade > 1.0)
quizzes_grade = 1.0;
quizzes_grade = floor (5 * quizzes_grade );
10

- Assessment - Exam
- one hour in-person Examsys exam
- some time between 12-24 January 2026
- 25% of your overall module grade
- questions will be on any topic in the module
- more details given towards end of module
11

- Programming Books
- The C Programming Language (2ndedition)
- Kernighan and Ritchie = K&R
- ISBN: 978-0131103627
- essential and worthwhile - get it and read it !
12

- Programming Books
- Learn C the Hard Way: Practical Exercises on the
Computational Subjects You Keep Avoiding (Like C)
- Zed A.

Shaw, Addison-Wesley
- ISBN: 978-0321884923
- optional - good for advanced programmers
13

- Algorithms Books

- Steven S.

Skiena, Springer
- ISBN: 978-1848000698
- alternative
15

- Software
- This module uses Linux andopen-source software
- As discussed in Welcome to the Machine Session
- More details in this week’s labs
- You can either:
- best: run your own distribution
- OK: use a Omnissa Horizon and the School’s Linux Virtual
Desktop
- Running your own Linux:
- Linux users - you are there already
- Mac users - you are almost there - install VirtualBox/UTM
- Windows users - VirtualBox ordual-boot
- Any Linux distro will do: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, SUSE,
CentOS, Fedora ...
16

- Expectations
- You are expected to:
- review the weekly filecture package videos and slides in the
Monday online filecture slot
- use the course book and other online resources to do more in
depth study of the material in the weekly filecture packages
- attend in person the Tuesday filecture slot
- attend in person your allocated lab slot
- attend in person your allocated tutorial slot
- complete all weekly tutorial activities the week they are
released
- complete the weekly moodle quiz
- complete each coursework assignment the week it is released:
- do not spend an excessive amount of time trying to achieve
full marks
- you do not need to get full marks on each coursework to do
well and get a good overall grade on this module
- attendance is monitored for all timetables slots - QR codes
