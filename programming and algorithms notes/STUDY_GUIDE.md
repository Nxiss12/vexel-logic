## 📝 Study Tips

### Daily Practice
1. **Code Every Day** - Even 30 minutes helps build muscle memory
2. **Type, Don't Copy** - Typing code helps you understand it better
3. **Debug Your Own Code** - Learn to find and fix errors independently
4. **Comment Your Code** - Practice explaining what your code does

### Understanding Concepts
1. **Draw It Out** - Visualize memory, pointers, data structures
2. **Explain To Others** - Teaching solidifies understanding
3. **Break It Down** - Complex problems into smaller pieces
4. **Ask "Why?"** - Don't just memorize, understand the reasoning

### Exam Preparation
1. **Practice Writing Code By Hand** - Exam may be written
2. **Understand Error Messages** - Know what they mean
3. **Review Your Coursework** - Understand feedback
4. **Time Yourself** - Practice under time pressure

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Academic Integrity
- ❌ **NO AI-generated code** (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- ❌ **NO copying** from others
- ✅ **DO ask for help** understanding concepts
- ✅ **DO collaborate** on learning, not solutions

### Attendance
- Attendance is monitored for all timetabled slots (QR codes)
- Attend all lectures, labs, and tutorials
- Missing sessions means missing important information

### Coursework Strategy
- **Don't aim for perfection** on every assignment
- Complete assignments the week they're released
- Good overall grade doesn't require 100% on everything
- Time management is key
