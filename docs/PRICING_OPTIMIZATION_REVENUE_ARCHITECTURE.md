## 🎯 PRICING STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

### Value-Based Pricing Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Price based on VALUE DELIVERED (not cost to produce)

**Value Metrics:**
- **Time Savings:** £25/hour (avg SME labor cost) × 20 hours/week = £500/week = £26k/year
- **Revenue Recovery:** £4.2k/month (missed calls) = £50k/year
- **Total Annual Value:** £76k/year delivered
- **Current Pricing:** £3k-£8k/year (4-10% of value delivered)
- **Value Capture:** We capture 4-10% of value (leave 90-96% with customer)

**Pricing Power:**
- ROI Ratio: 10:1 to 25:1 (every £1 spent → £10-£25 value)
- **Strategic Insight:** We have significant pricing power (room to increase 50-100% if needed)

---

## 📊 PRICING OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Opportunity #1: Add Usage-Based Pricing (Hybrid Model)

**Revenue Impact:**

**Recommendation:** Test with new customers Month 9-12, roll out if successful

---

### Opportunity #2: Vertical-Specific Pricing

**Current Model:** Same price regardless of industry  
**Proposed Model:** Price based on industry willingness-to-pay

**Industry Value Perception:**

| Industry | Current Price | Proposed Price | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Trades** (Plumbing, Electrical) | £249/mo | £249/mo | Keep same (price-sensitive) |

| **E-commerce** | £249/mo | £199/mo | -20% (high churn, competitive market) |

**Revenue Impact:**
- **Healthcare Uplift:** £100/mo × 15 customers = £1,500/mo = £18k/year
- **Legal Uplift:** £300/mo × 5 customers = £1,500/mo = £18k/year

## 📈 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY & TACTICS

### Anchoring Effect

**Strategy:** Show highest-tier pricing first (Enterprise £1,500/mo) → makes £697/mo seem reasonable

**Current Order:** Foundation → Growth → Professional → Enterprise  
**Proposed Order:** Enterprise → Professional → Growth → Foundation

**Impact:** 15-20% increase in Professional plan selection (anchoring bias)

---

### Decoy Pricing

**Strategy:** Add middle tier that makes target tier look attractive

**Example:**
- Growth: £249/mo (basic)
- **DECOY: Professional Lite: £497/mo (Professional features - Intelligence)**
- Professional: £697/mo (everything) ← **Target (best value)**

**Impact:** 80% choose Professional (vs. 60% currently)

---

### Price Framing

**Current Framing:** £697/mo  
**Proposed Framing:** £23/day (sounds cheaper)

**Example:** "Less than a cup of coffee per day to automate your entire business"

**Impact:** Reduces sticker shock, increases trial signups by 10-15%

---

### Urgency & Scarcity

**Tactics:**
- "Early Bird Pricing: £249/mo → £299/mo on Jan 1, 2026" (locks in current customers)
- "Limited Availability: Only 10 Enterprise slots/quarter" (creates FOMO)
- "Founder's Pricing: First 100 customers get lifetime 20% discount" (early adopter incentive)
