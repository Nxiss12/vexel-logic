- Professional: $49/month (2,000 tasks)
- Team: $299/month (50,000 tasks)

- **Don't compete head-to-head** on integrations (they have 6,000, we have 20)
- **Compete on service + intelligence** (white-glove vs. self-service)
- **Position as "UK alternative"** (data sovereignty, local support)
- **Target customers who tried Zapier and failed** (too complex, no support)

### Indirect Competitors (Vertical SaaS)

#### 4. **HUBSPOT** - Enterprise Marketing Automation

**Why They're a Threat:**

- Targeting same SME segment (upmarket push)

**Why We Win:**
- **Price:** £800-£3,200/mo (HubSpot) vs. £249-£697/mo (Vexel)

- **Setup Time:** 2-3 months (HubSpot) vs. 48 hours (Vexel)

---

#### 5. **INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC TOOLS**

**Trades:**
- **Jobber, ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro**
- Strength: Industry-specific features (dispatching, GPS tracking)
- Weakness: Don't automate across tools (CRM only, not full automation)

**Healthcare:**

---

## 💡 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES (Our Moats)

### 1. **Data Moat (Strongest)**

**How it works:**
- Customer data trains our ML models (lead scoring, churn prediction)
- More customers = better predictions = higher value
- **Switching cost:** Leave Vexel = lose predictive insights

**Defensibility:** HIGH (hard to replicate without customer data)

**Time to build moat:** 12-24 months (need 100+ customers for statistically significant models)

---

### 2. **Service Moat (Strong)**

**How it works:**
- White-glove onboarding creates personal relationship
- Quarterly business reviews = ongoing partnership
- Proactive optimization = "we care about your success"

**Defensibility:** MEDIUM (competitors can copy, but requires culture shift)

**Competitive advantage:** "Customer success is product feature" (not afterthought)

---

### 3. **UK-Specific Moat (Medium)**

**How it works:**
- UK data centers (GDPR compliance)
- Direct Debit via GoCardless (UK payment method)
- Sage integration (70% UK SME market share)
- UK-based support (no timezone issues)

**Defensibility:** MEDIUM (Zapier could add UK features, but cultural/operational challenge)

**Competitive advantage:** "Built for UK SMEs" (not retrofitted)

---

### 4. **Vertical Expertise Moat (Medium)**

**How it works:**
- Industry-specific templates (Trades, Healthcare, Legal)
- Vertical-specific integrations (e.g., Dentally for dental practices)
- Industry benchmarks (compare to peers)

**Defensibility:** MEDIUM (takes 6-12 months to build vertical expertise)

**Competitive advantage:** "Built for plumbers" (vs. "built for everyone")

---

## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Where to Compete:

✅ **DO Compete On:**
1. **Service & Support** (white-glove vs. DIY)
2. **UK-Specificity** (data sovereignty, local features)
3. **Intelligence Layer** (predictive vs. reactive)
4. **Vertical Expertise** (industry templates vs. generic)

❌ **DON'T Compete On:**
1. **Number of Integrations** (Zapier has 6,000, we have 20)
2. **Price** (race to bottom benefits no one)
3. **Enterprise Features** (focus on SMEs, not Fortune 500)
4. **Global Expansion** (UK-first, then EU, don't spread thin)

---

### Next Actions:

- **Week 1:** Set up competitor monitoring (Visualping, Google Alerts)
