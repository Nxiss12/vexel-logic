- Website behavior (pages visited, demo video watched, calculator used)
- Communication patterns (response time, question quality)
- Firmographic data (industry, company size, location)
- Historical conversion data (train model on past customers)

**Output:**
- Lead Score (0-100) with conversion probability
- Priority Queue (Hot/Warm/Cold classification)
- Recommended Next Action ("Call within 24 hrs" or "Send case study")

**Machine Learning Model:**
- Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost)
- Training Data: 500+ leads (100 converted, 400 didn't convert)
- Features: 25+ behavioral + firmographic signals
- Accuracy Target: >70% precision, >60% recall

**Technical Implementation:**

```python
# Pseudocode: Lead Scoring Model

import xgboost as xgb

# Load training data
leads = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM leads WHERE created_at < '2025-11-01'", db)

# Feature engineering
leads['email_engagement_score'] = (
    leads['email_opens'] * 2 + 
    leads['email_clicks'] * 5 + 
    leads['demo_watched'] * 10
)

leads['firmographic_score'] = (
    leads['is_trades_industry'] * 30 +
    leads['is_uk_based'] * 20 +
    leads['employee_count'].apply(lambda x: 15 if 10 <= x <= 50 else 0)
)

# Train model
X = leads[['email_engagement_score', 'firmographic_score', ...]]
y = leads['converted']  # 1 = converted, 0 = didn't convert

model = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=5, n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict on new leads
new_leads = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM leads WHERE score IS NULL", db)
new_leads['conversion_probability'] = model.predict_proba(new_leads)[:, 1]
new_leads['lead_score'] = new_leads['conversion_probability'] * 100

)

customers['risk_flag'] = (
    (customers['days_since_last_login'] > 14) | 
    (customers['avg_support_sentiment'] < 3.0)
).astype(int)

# Train model
X = customers[['engagement_score', 'risk_flag', 'days_since_last_login', ...]]
y = customers['churned']

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict churn risk for active customers
active = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM customers WHERE status = 'active'", db)
active['churn_probability'] = model.predict_proba(active)[:, 1]
active['churn_risk'] = active['churn_probability'].apply(
    lambda x: 'High' if x > 0.7 else ('Medium' if x > 0.4 else 'Low')
)

# Trigger interventions
high_risk = active[active['churn_risk'] == 'High']
for customer in high_risk.itertuples():

            'revenue_impact': customer.mrr * 2.8  # £249 → £697
        })
    
    # Rule 2: Not using Intelligence Layer → Suggest add-on
    if not customer.has_intelligence_layer:
        similar_customers = db.query(
            "SELECT AVG(revenue_increase_pct) FROM customers WHERE has_intelligence_layer = true AND industry = ?", 
            customer.industry
        )

### Phase 2: Optimization Recommendations (Months 7-9) - GENERAL AVAILABILITY

#### 2.1 Workflow Efficiency Analyzer

**Purpose:** Identify bottlenecks in customer workflows, recommend fixes

**Data Inputs:**
- Time-to-complete metrics (how long does invoicing take?)
- Error rates (how often do workflows fail?)
- Manual touchpoints (where does human intervention occur?)
- Industry benchmarks (how do others do this?)

**Output:**
- Bottleneck Identification ("Your invoicing takes 12 min avg - benchmark is 3 min")
- Optimization Recommendations ("Automate step 3 → reduce to 2 min")
- ROI Projection ("Save 10 hours/month = £150 value")

**Analysis Engine:**

```python
# Pseudocode: Workflow Efficiency Analysis

def analyze_workflow(customer, workflow_type='invoicing'):
    # Get customer's workflow data
    workflows = db.query("""
        SELECT 
            AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, completed_at)) as avg_time,
            COUNT(*) as total_executions,
            SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'error' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as error_count
        FROM workflow_executions
        WHERE customer_id = ? AND workflow_type = ?
        AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
    """, customer.id, workflow_type)
    
    # Get benchmark data
    benchmark = db.query("""
        SELECT 
            AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, completed_at)) as avg_time
        FROM workflow_executions
        WHERE workflow_type = ? AND status = 'completed'
        AND customer_id IN (SELECT id FROM customers WHERE industry = ?)
    """, workflow_type, customer.industry)
    
    # Identify bottlenecks
    recommendations = []
    if workflows['avg_time'] > benchmark['avg_time'] * 1.5:
        time_savings = workflows['avg_time'] - benchmark['avg_time']
        recommendations.append({
            'workflow': workflow_type,
            'current_time': workflows['avg_time'],
            'benchmark_time': benchmark['avg_time'],
            'optimization': 'Automate manual steps',
            'time_savings_per_execution': time_savings,
            'monthly_executions': workflows['total_executions'],
            'total_monthly_savings': time_savings * workflows['total_executions'],
            'roi_value': time_savings * workflows['total_executions'] * (customer.avg_hourly_rate / 60)
        })
    
    return recommendations

#### 2.2 Pricing Optimization Algorithm

**Purpose:** Recommend optimal pricing based on market data and elasticity

**Data Inputs:**
- Customer's current pricing (for their services/products)
- Competitor pricing (scraped or manually entered)
- Conversion rates at different price points
- Customer willingness-to-pay signals (quote acceptance rate)

**Output:**
- Recommended Price Change ("Increase by 8% → minimal churn risk, £14k extra/year")
- Price Elasticity Estimate ("10% price increase → 3% demand decrease")
- Revenue Maximization Point (optimal price for max profit)

**Analysis Engine:**

```python
# Pseudocode: Pricing Optimization

def optimize_pricing(customer):
    # Get customer's historical pricing & conversion data
    quotes = db.query("""
        SELECT 
            quote_amount,
            CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as converted
        FROM quotes
        WHERE customer_id = ? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 6 MONTH
    """, customer.id)
    
    # Estimate price elasticity (conversion rate at different prices)
    elasticity = calculate_elasticity(quotes)
    # elasticity = % change in demand / % change in price
    
    # Recommend price increase if elasticity < 1 (inelastic)
    if elasticity < 0.5:  # Demand insensitive to price
        current_avg_price = quotes['quote_amount'].mean()
        recommended_price = current_avg_price * 1.08  # 8% increase
        
        annual_revenue_current = customer.avg_monthly_jobs * 12 * current_avg_price
        annual_revenue_new = customer.avg_monthly_jobs * 12 * recommended_price * (1 - elasticity * 0.08)
        
        return {
            'current_price': current_avg_price,
            'recommended_price': recommended_price,
            'price_increase_pct': 8,
            'expected_demand_decrease_pct': elasticity * 8,  # e.g., 0.3 * 8 = 2.4%
            'annual_revenue_increase': annual_revenue_new - annual_revenue_current,
            'confidence': 'High' if len(quotes) > 50 else 'Medium'
        }
```

**User Experience:**

```
💰 PRICING OPTIMIZATION INSIGHT

Based on your last 6 months of quoting data (87 quotes, 64% acceptance rate):

RECOMMENDATION: Increase prices by 8%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Avg Price: £450 per job
Recommended Price: £486 per job (+£36)

Expected Impact:
📈 Revenue Increase: £14,200/year
📉 Demand Decrease: -2.4% (minimal)
💼 Jobs Lost: ~2 jobs/year (vs. 15 gained from price increase)

Why This Works:
✅ Your quote acceptance rate is 64% (very high - indicates underpricing)
✅ Customers rarely negotiate (75% accept first quote → price insensitive)
✅ Similar businesses in your area charge £475-£520

Confidence Level: HIGH (based on 87 quotes)

   (3,000 SMS) ensures you never miss a lead.
   
   Expected Impact: Handle 3x more volume without limits
   Cost: £448/month additional (£697 - £249)
   ROI: Unlimited growth potential

### Phase 2: Optimization Recommendations (Months 7-9) - GENERAL AVAILABILITY

#### 2.1 Workflow Efficiency Analyzer

**Purpose:** Identify bottlenecks in customer workflows, recommend fixes

**Data Inputs:**
- Time-to-complete metrics (how long does invoicing take?)
- Error rates (how often do workflows fail?)
- Manual touchpoints (where does human intervention occur?)
- Industry benchmarks (how do others do this?)

**Output:**
- Bottleneck Identification ("Your invoicing takes 12 min avg - benchmark is 3 min")
- Optimization Recommendations ("Automate step 3 → reduce to 2 min")
- ROI Projection ("Save 10 hours/month = £150 value")

**Analysis Engine:**

```python
# Pseudocode: Workflow Efficiency Analysis

def analyze_workflow(customer, workflow_type='invoicing'):
    # Get customer's workflow data
    workflows = db.query("""
        SELECT

#### 2.2 Pricing Optimization Algorithm

**Purpose:** Recommend optimal pricing based on market data and elasticity

**Data Inputs:**
- Customer's current pricing (for their services/products)
- Competitor pricing (scraped or manually entered)
- Conversion rates at different price points
- Customer willingness-to-pay signals (quote acceptance rate)

**Output:**
- Recommended Price Change ("Increase by 8% → minimal churn risk, £14k extra/year")
- Price Elasticity Estimate ("10% price increase → 3% demand decrease")
- Revenue Maximization Point (optimal price for max profit)

**Analysis Engine:**

```python
# Pseudocode: Pricing Optimization

def optimize_pricing(customer):
    # Get customer's historical pricing & conversion data
    quotes = db.query("""
        SELECT 
            quote_amount,
            CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as converted
        FROM quotes
        WHERE customer_id = ? AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 6 MONTH
    """, customer.id)
    
    # Estimate price elasticity (conversion rate at different prices)
    elasticity = calculate_elasticity(quotes)
    # elasticity = % change in demand / % change in price
    
    # Recommend price increase if elasticity < 1 (inelastic)
    if elasticity < 0.5:  # Demand insensitive to price
        current_avg_price = quotes['quote_amount'].mean()
        recommended_price = current_avg_price * 1.08  # 8% increase
        
        annual_revenue_current = customer.avg_monthly_jobs * 12 * current_avg_price
        annual_revenue_new = customer.avg_monthly_jobs * 12 * recommended_price * (1 - elasticity * 0.08)
        
        return {
            'current_price': current_avg_price,
            'recommended_price': recommended_price,
            'price_increase_pct': 8,
            'expected_demand_decrease_pct': elasticity * 8,  # e.g., 0.3 * 8 = 2.4%
            'annual_revenue_increase': annual_revenue_new - annual_revenue_current,
            'confidence': 'High' if len(quotes) > 50 else 'Medium'
        }
```

**User Experience:**

```
💰 PRICING OPTIMIZATION INSIGHT

Based on your last 6 months of quoting data (87 quotes, 64% acceptance rate):

RECOMMENDATION: Increase prices by 8%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current Avg Price: £450 per job
Recommended Price: £486 per job (+£36)

Expected Impact:
📈 Revenue Increase: £14,200/year
📉 Demand Decrease: -2.4% (minimal)
💼 Jobs Lost: ~2 jobs/year (vs. 15 gained from price increase)

Why This Works:
✅ Your quote acceptance rate is 64% (very high - indicates underpricing)
✅ Customers rarely negotiate (75% accept first quote → price insensitive)
✅ Similar businesses in your area charge £475-£520

Confidence Level: HIGH (based on 87 quotes)

📧 VEXEL INTELLIGENCE: WEEKLY INSIGHTS

Hi Owen,

Here are your top 3 opportunities this week:

1. 🎯 HIGH-PRIORITY OPPORTUNITY: Upsell to Professional Plan
   You used 940 of your 1,000 SMS quota this month (94%). At your current 
   growth rate, you'll hit the limit next month. Upgrading to Professional 
   (3,000 SMS) ensures you never miss a lead.
   
   Expected Impact: Handle 3x more volume without limits
   Cost: £448/month additional (£697 - £249)
   ROI: Unlimited growth potential
   
   [UPGRADE NOW]

2. 💰 REVENUE OPPORTUNITY: Increase your pricing by 8%
   Your quote acceptance rate is 68% (very high). Similar plumbers charge 
   £475-£520 (you're at £450). Raising to £486 would add £14,200/year with 
   minimal demand impact (-2.4%).
   
   [SEE FULL ANALYSIS]

3. ⚠️ WORKFLOW BOTTLENECK: Invoicing taking too long
   You're spending 12 minutes per invoice vs. 3-minute industry benchmark.

## 📝 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Why Intelligence Layer Wins:

1. **Moat Building:** Customer data trains models → models get better → harder to switch
2. **Category Creation:** "Business Intelligence Automation" (not just automation)
3. **Premium Pricing:** Justify £697/mo (vs. £249/mo) = 180% increase
4. **Churn Prevention:** Insights = reason to never leave (3-5% churn reduction)
5. **Competitive Differentiation:** Zapier = dumb automation, Vexel = smart optimization

### Risks to Manage:

1. **Accuracy Risk:** If predictions wrong → customer distrust (mitigate: show confidence scores)
2. **Complexity Risk:** Too much data → overwhelms users (mitigate: start with 3 insights/week)
3. **Privacy Risk:** Customers fear data usage (mitigate: transparency, opt-in, anonymization)
4. **Execution Risk:** ML models require expertise (mitigate: hire contractor Month 4)

### Next Actions:

- **Week 1:** Design Intelligence data schema (PostgreSQL tables)
- **Week 2:** Hire ML contractor (£50/hour, 120-hour contract)
- **Week 3:** Build Lead Scoring MVP (Week 3-6)
- **Week 4:** Beta test with 5 customers (get feedback)
- **Month 6:** Public beta launch (all customers)
