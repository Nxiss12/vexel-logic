**2. Map Current State (40 min)**
For each high-value task:
- **Trigger:** What starts this process?
- **Steps:** What happens (manual steps)?
- **Time:** How long does it take?
- **Frequency:** How often?
- **Output:** What's the result?
- **Pain points:** Where does it break down?

**3. Design Future State (40 min)**
