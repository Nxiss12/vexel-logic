## The Trap of Analysis Paralysis

These strategic frameworks are powerful when you have:
- Established product-market fit
- 10+ paying customers
- Clear growth trajectory
- Team to implement strategies

**Right now, you have:**
- A great product
- No customers yet
- Need to validate the market

**Strategy without execution = zero.**

**Execute first. Strategize second.**
