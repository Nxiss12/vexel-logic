## 🚫 WHAT WE WON'T BUILD (Strategic Choices)

### Anti-Roadmap (Prevent Scope Creep)

| Feature Request | Why We're Saying NO | Alternative |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Project Management (full Asana clone)** | Out of scope - focus on automation, not PM | Integrate with Asana/Trello |
| **Video Conferencing** | Zoom does this better | Integrate with Zoom/Google Meet |
| **Email Marketing (full Mailchimp clone)** | Mailchimp/Klaviyo too strong | Integrate, don't replace |
| **Accounting Software** | Xero/QuickBooks own this | Integrate, don't compete |
| **Website Builder** | Wix/Squarespace do this | Partner, don't build |
| **Full ERP System** | Too complex for SMEs, enterprise territory | Stay focused on SME automation |

**Strategic Principle:** "Integrate, don't replicate" - connect best-in-class tools, don't rebuild them

---

## 🔄 ROADMAP REVIEW PROCESS

### Quarterly Reviews:

**Q4 2025 Review (Month 3):**
- Validate: Did first 10 customers achieve ROI?
- Adjust: What features are customers actually using?
- Pivot: Any unexpected use cases?

**Q1 2026 Review (Month 6):**
- Validate: Is Intelligence Layer delivering value?
- Adjust: Which vertical to prioritize (Trades, Healthcare, Legal)?
- Pivot: Are partnerships working?

**Q2 2026 Review (Month 9):**
- Validate: Path to 50 customers on track?
- Adjust: Pricing optimization needed?
- Pivot: Expand geographically or vertically?

### Annual Strategic Offsite (Month 12, 24, 36):

**Agenda:**
1. Review previous year: What worked? What didn't?
2. Customer interviews: 20+ customers (pain points, requests)
3. Competitive analysis: What did competitors ship?
4. Market trends: What's changing in SME landscape?
5. Team input: What do we want to build?
6. Prioritize next year's roadmap (RICE scoring)

---

## 📝 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Why This Roadmap Wins:

1. **Focus:** Say no to feature creep (integrate, don't replicate)
2. **Validation:** Launch small (beta), iterate based on feedback
3. **Differentiation:** Intelligence Layer = moat (data advantage compounds)
4. **Timing:** Vertical products when we have 50+ customers (proof of demand)
5. **Sequencing:** Foundation → Intelligence → Platform (logical progression)

### Risk Mitigation:

1. **Competitor Risk:** Intelligence Layer by Month 6 (before Zapier catches up)
2. **Churn Risk:** Retention initiatives from Month 3 (prevent leaky bucket)
3. **Execution Risk:** Hire CS Month 4, Eng Month 6 (don't stay solo founder too long)
4. **Market Risk:** Test 3 verticals (Trades, Healthcare, Legal) to find best fit

### Next Actions:

- **Week 1:** Finalize Q4 2025 feature list (Missed Call Bot v2.0, Unified Inbox)
- **Week 2:** Design Intelligence Layer data schema (prep for Month 6 launch)
- **Week 3:** Interview first 10 customers (validate roadmap assumptions)
- **Week 4:** Publish roadmap publicly (transparency builds trust)
