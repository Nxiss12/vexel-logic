## Value-Based Pricing

**Always present price in context of value:**

### Bad:
"It costs £249 per month."

### Good:
"You're losing £23k per year to missed opportunities. 
This costs £2,988 per year and recovers 30-50% of that.

So you're looking at £7-12k in recovered revenue, 
for an investment of £3k. That's a 3:1 to 4:1 return."

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring

**Always show highest price first:**

1. Enterprise: Custom (£1,500+/mo)
2. Professional: £697/mo
3. Growth: £249/mo ← Makes this look affordable

---

### Annual Discounts

**Offer 20% off for annual payment:**

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Savings |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| Growth | £249 | £2,390 (£199/mo) | £598 |
| Professional | £697 | £6,696 (£558/mo) | £1,668 |

**Benefits:**
- Better cash flow (money upfront)
- Lower churn (locked in for year)
- Customer saves money

**When to offer:**
- When price is the objection
- When you want commitment
- When cash flow is important

---

## When to Discount

### DO Discount When:

**1. Annual commitment**
- 20% off for annual payment
- Fair trade: commitment for discount

**2. Multiple referrals**
- 1 month free per referral that converts
- Cap at 3 months/year

**3. Strategic account**
- Good case study potential
- Industry leader
- High visibility
- Max 30% off first year only

**4. Competitive situation**
- They're comparing you to cheaper alternative
- Match or beat by max 20%

---

### DON'T Discount When:

**1. First conversation**
- Hold your price initially
- They haven't earned discount yet

**2. No commitment**
- Don't discount month-to-month
- Discounts require commitment

**3. Bad fit customer**
- If they haggle aggressively
- If they don't see value
- They'll churn anyway

**4. Out of desperation**
- Discounting doesn't fix bad product
- Attracts wrong customers

---

## Pricing Objections & Responses

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand. Let me ask - what's one new customer worth to you?"

*(They say £800)*

"And how many customers do you think you're losing to missed calls per month?"

*(They say 3-5)*

"So that's £2,400-£4,000 in lost revenue per month. 
Our system costs £249/month and recovers 30-50% of that.

You're looking at £700-2,000 recovered per month, 
for £249 investment. Does that math work?"

---

### "I need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course. What specifically are you thinking about?"

*(Listen for real objection)*

"How about this - we have a 7-day trial. 
Zero risk. If it doesn't work, cancel anytime. 
Want to just try it?"

---

### "Can I start with just one tool?"

**Response:**
"I get it - you want to test before committing.

Here's the challenge: these tools work best together. 
Missed Call Bot captures the lead, Unified Inbox manages them, 
Review Engine converts them to testimonials.

That said, I can do £149/month for just Missed Call Bot 
for the first month. After that, upgrade to full package 
or continue at £249 (which includes everything).

Fair?"
