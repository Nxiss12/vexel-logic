## LinkedIn Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Connection Request (CEO/Founder)

```
Hi [First Name],

Saw you're scaling [Company] – impressive growth in [industry]!

I help growth-stage founders like you amplify their team's productivity so they can scale without burning out.

Would love to connect and share what's working for companies in [their industry].
```

**Character Count:** 247 (LinkedIn limit: 300)

---

### Template 2: Connection Request (COO/Ops Director)

```
Hi [First Name],

Leading operations at [Company] during growth is no small feat.

I work with ops teams to eliminate 15+ hours/week of repetitive work so they can focus on strategic initiatives instead of firefighting.

Let's connect?
```

**Character Count:** 225

---

### Template 3: Follow-Up Message (After Connection Accepted)

```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question: Where is your team spending time on repetitive tasks that could be automated?

I'm launching a pilot program for 5 growth-stage companies to transform how their teams work – 50% off + proven 30-day implementation.

Specifically built for companies like [Company] that are scaling fast and need their team focused on high-value work, not admin.

Interested in a 15-min chat to see if it's a fit?
```

---

### Template 4: Value-First Follow-Up

```
[First Name] – thought you might find this useful:

I just mapped out the 5 most common time-wasters for [their role] at growth-stage companies:

1. Manual data entry (8-12 hrs/week)
2. Email follow-ups (6-8 hrs/week)  
3. Scheduling coordination (3-5 hrs/week)
4. Report generation (4-6 hrs/week)
5. Lead qualification (5-8 hrs/week)

Which one hits closest to home for your team?

I'm helping a small group of founders eliminate these bottlenecks with intelligent automation – 30-day turnaround, 15hrs/week guaranteed savings.

Open to a quick call this week to explore if it makes sense for [Company]?
```

---

### Template 5: Pilot Program Invite

```
[First Name],

I'm launching VexelLogic's pilot program and hand-picking 5 companies to work with.

**What you get:**
✅ 50% off setup (£2,500 instead of £5,000)
✅ 3 months free monthly subscription (£1,500 value)
✅ 30-day implementation with guaranteed 15hrs/week time savings
✅ You'll be featured as a founding customer case study

**What I need from you:**
- Willingness to provide feedback during implementation
- Participate in case study (before/after metrics + testimonial)
- Start within 2 weeks

Based on [Company]'s focus on [their priority], I think you'd be perfect.

Interest in a 20-min call to discuss?

P.S. Only taking 5 companies, first-come basis.
```

---

## Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Warm Introduction Email (Personal Network)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well!

I'm launching something I thought might be perfect for [Company].

You know how growth-stage companies struggle with their team drowning in repetitive work? Sales people spending 20 hours/week on data entry instead of selling. Ops teams buried in manual processes.

I've built a system that eliminates 15+ hours/week of repetitive tasks per employee in 30 days. Called it "Employee Amplification" instead of "automation" because it's not about replacing people – it's about unleashing them to do the work you actually hired them for.

I'm launching with 5 pilot companies at 50% off (£2,500-£6,500 instead of £5K-£13K). In exchange, they participate in a case study and provide feedback.

Based on [specific thing you know about their business], I think [Company] would be a great fit.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week to explore if it makes sense?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's an example: One sales guy was spending 18 hours/week finding prospects on LinkedIn. Now he spends 2 hours reviewing AI-found leads and 18 hours closing. Same guy. 3x more pipeline.
```

---

### Template 2: Referral Request Email

**Subject:** Know any founders/COOs scaling fast?

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick favor to ask:

I'm launching a pilot program to help growth-stage companies (10-100 employees) amplify their team's productivity.

Target is companies where the team is drowning in repetitive work and can't keep up with growth.

The offer: I implement intelligent automation systems that guarantee 15+ hours/week time savings per employee, 30-day turnaround. Pilot pricing is 50% off.

Do you know any founders or COOs who'd benefit from getting 15 hours/week back for each of their key people?

Happy to give you a referral fee if they sign up: £500 per pilot customer.

Just intro me via email or LinkedIn and I'll take it from there.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

## Industry Group Outreach

### Facebook/Slack Post Template

```
💡 FREE AUDIT: Where is your team wasting time?

I'm offering 5 free "time waste audits" for growth-stage companies this week.

Here's what happens:
1. 20-min call with you (founder/ops lead)
2. I identify where your team spends time on repetitive tasks
3. You get a report showing exactly how to reclaim 15+ hours/week per person
4. Zero obligation

Why am I doing this?
Launching a pilot program and want to show value upfront. If you love the audit, we can talk about implementation (50% off for pilot companies).

Comment "INTERESTED" or DM me if you want one of the 5 spots.

First come, first served.
```

I'll send you a Calendly link – pick whatever time works best for you this week.

Before the call, can you quickly think about:
1. Which 2-3 people on your team spend the most time on repetitive tasks
2. What those tasks are (data entry, follow-ups, scheduling, etc.)

## Qualification Call Script

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes

**Agenda:**

**1. Introduction (2 min)**
- "Thanks for taking the time, [Name]."
- "I want to make sure this pilot is a good fit for both of us, so I'll ask some questions about your team's current situation."
- "Sound good?"

**2. Discovery (10 min)**

**Question 1: Team Structure**
"Tell me about your team structure – how many people, what are their roles?"

Listen for:
- Team size (10-100 ideal)
- Key roles (sales, ops, customer success)
- Growth trajectory

**Question 2: Current Pain Points**
"Where are they spending time on repetitive tasks?"

Listen for:
- Specific tasks consuming 10+ hours/week
- Frustration with current workflows
- Impact on business (losing leads, can't scale)

**Question 3: Previous Attempts**
"Have you tried automation before? What happened?"

Listen for:
- Openness to change
- Past failures (and why)
- Resistance from team

**Question 4: Success Vision**
"If I could give you 15 hours/week back for [key person], what would you have them do instead?"

Listen for:
- Strategic priorities
- Revenue opportunities
- Growth blockers

**Question 5: Timeline & Budget**
"Timeline-wise, how soon would you want to start?"
"Budget-wise, pilot pricing is £2,500-£6,500 for setup + 3 months free subscription. Does that work?"

Listen for:
- Urgency (ideal: start within 2 weeks)
- Budget authority (can they say yes?)
- Decision-making process

**3. Pilot Program Explanation (5 min)**

"Here's what the pilot looks like:

**What you get:**
- 50% off setup fee (£2,500-£6,500 vs £5K-£13K)
- 3 months free monthly subscription (£1,500-£3,000 value)
- 30-day implementation – we do everything for you
- Guaranteed 15 hours/week minimum time savings per employee
- If we don't hit 15 hours, you get a full refund

**What I need from you:**
- Access to your tools (CRM, email, etc.) for integration
- Time-tracking for 1 week to establish baseline
- 2-3 hours of your time over 30 days for check-ins
- Feedback during implementation (help us make it better)
- Testimonial and case study participation after (with your metrics)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Assessment & workflow mapping
- Week 2: System design & approval
- Weeks 3-4: Build & deploy
- Day 30: Go live + results review

Sound like something [Company] would benefit from?"

**4. Objection Handling**

**Objection: "We're too busy right now"**
Response: "I get that – but that's exactly the problem we solve. The time investment is 2-3 hours over 30 days. The return is 15+ hours every single week after. It's the best trade-off you'll make."

**Objection: "We tried automation before and it didn't work"**
Response: "What didn't work about it? [Listen] Here's how we're different: [address their specific concern]. Plus, with the refund guarantee, there's zero risk."

**Objection: "I need to think about it / talk to my team"**
Response: "Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think through? [Address concerns]. Keep in mind, I'm only taking 5 pilot companies and spots are filling up. When do you think you'd have a decision?"

**Objection: "That's still expensive for a pilot"**
Response: "Let's do the math: [Key employee] makes £50K/year, so £25/hour. If we save them 15 hours/week, that's £375/week or £19,500/year in value. Your investment is £2,500. That's 13x ROI in year one. Make sense?"

**5. Close (3 min)**

**If Qualified & Interested:**
"Awesome! Let's lock in your pilot spot. I'll send over:
1. Pilot agreement (simple 2-pager)
2. Invoice for 50% deposit (£1,250-£3,250)
3. Kickoff call calendar invite (we'll start next week)

Once I have those back, I'll begin the assessment process. Questions?"

**If Needs Time:**
"No problem. I'll send you a one-pager summarizing everything we discussed + the pilot terms. Take 48 hours to review, then let's reconnect. When's good for a 10-minute follow-up?"

**If Not a Fit:**
"Appreciate your time, [Name]. Based on what you've shared, I don't think the pilot is the right fit right now. [Explain why]. Let's stay in touch though – here's my LinkedIn if you want to connect."
