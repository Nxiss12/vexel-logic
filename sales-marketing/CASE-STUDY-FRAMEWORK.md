## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences summarizing the problem, solution, and results]

Example:
"TechCo's sales team was spending 20 hours/week on manual prospecting and data entry, leaving little time for actual selling. VexelLogic implemented intelligent automation systems that reduced admin work to 2 hours/week. Result: Same team, 3x more pipeline, and £180K additional revenue in 90 days."

---

## The Challenge

### The Situation

[3-4 paragraphs describing the company, their growth stage, and the specific problem]

Example:
"TechCo is a fast-growing B2B SaaS company with 45 employees. After raising their Series A, they were scaling rapidly but hitting a bottleneck: their sales team couldn't keep up with demand.

Tom Harrison, their Head of Sales, had a team of 5 reps. Each rep was spending 20 hours per week finding prospects on LinkedIn, copying information into their CRM, and manually sending outreach emails. They were only spending 15 hours per week actually talking to prospects and closing deals.

'We knew we had product-market fit,' says Sarah Chen, TechCo's CEO. 'But our sales process was killing us. Tom was brilliant at closing, but he was drowning in busy work. We couldn't afford to hire 3 more reps just to handle the admin.'"

### The Impact

**Before VexelLogic:**
- 20 hours/week per sales rep on manual prospecting
- 15 hours/week per rep on actual selling
- 50 qualified leads per rep per month
- 15% close rate on qualified leads
- £400K monthly revenue

**Pain Points:**
- ❌ Sales team burned out from repetitive work
- ❌ Losing deals to faster competitors
- ❌ Can't scale without expensive headcount
- ❌ Low team morale ("I didn't get into sales to do data entry")

> "We were leaving money on the table every single day. I calculated we were losing at least £15K/month in deals we simply didn't have time to pursue."  
> **— Tom Harrison, Head of Sales**

## Tips for Compelling Case Studies

### Do's ✅
- **Be specific:** "18 hours/week" beats "lots of time"
- **Use real names:** Named case studies perform 3x better
- **Show the math:** Walk through ROI calculation step-by-step
- **Include struggles:** Show challenges faced during implementation (builds trust)
- **Let client shine:** Make them the hero, not VexelLogic
- **Use visuals:** Charts, graphs, before/after screenshots
- **Get video:** Even 60 seconds of client talking is powerful

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't exaggerate:** Stick to verifiable metrics
- **Don't over-promise:** Focus on what you delivered, not what's possible
- **Don't make it about you:** Client's story comes first
- **Don't skip approval:** Always get written sign-off
- **Don't publish too early:** Wait for 60-day results, not 30-day
- **Don't forget CTAs:** Every case study needs clear next step
