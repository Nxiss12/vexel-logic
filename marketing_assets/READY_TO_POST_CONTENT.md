### POST 1: The Problem Awareness Post

```
🔴 The £23,000 Problem Nobody Talks About

I tracked missed calls across 20 UK service businesses.

The average? 5-8 missed calls per week.

Do the math:
• 6 missed calls × £800 avg job value
• 35% would have converted
• = £1,680/week walking out the door
• = £87,360/year

That's not theoretical. That's real money going to competitors who answered.

But here's what surprised me most:

When these businesses texted back within 30 seconds of missing the call, they recovered 64% of those leads.

Not 64% of sales. 64% of MISSED CALLS turned into booked jobs.

The difference between "I'll call them back later" and an instant text:
£55,990/year recovered.

What's your missed call costing you?

### POST 2: The Case Study

```
From £0 to £4,200/month recovered in 48 hours.

Here's exactly what happened:

James runs a plumbing business in Nottingham.
When we met, he was frustrated.

"I'm on job sites 10 hours a day. I can't answer every call."

I asked: "How many do you miss?"
He guessed 2-3/week.

We checked his phone. It was 8.

8 missed calls × £850 average job × 35% close rate = £2,380/week in potential lost revenue.

But we didn't just find the problem. We fixed it.

Within 48 hours, we set up:
✅ Instant SMS response to missed calls
✅ Automated quote follow-ups
✅ Review request triggers after payment

First month results:
• 23 missed calls captured
• 15 conversations started
• 6 jobs booked
• £4,200 in recovered revenue

His investment? £99/month.
His ROI? 42:1.

James's words: "I didn't think I was missing that many calls. The system paid for itself in the first 3 days."

That's what infrastructure does.
It catches the revenue you're already losing.

### POST 3: The Founder Story

```
Why I built Vexel Logic (and why I'm obsessed with automation):

2 years ago, I watched a brilliant electrician lose his business.

Not because he was bad at his job.
Because he was TOO good.

He was so busy doing the work that he:
- Missed calls from new customers
- Forgot to follow up on quotes
- Never had time to ask for reviews
- Spent his evenings doing admin

His 4.1-star Google rating didn't reflect his 5-star work.
His competitors with worse skills but better systems were winning.

That broke something in me.

The best tradespeople shouldn't lose to those with better admin.

So I started building.

First, a simple missed-call texter.
Then automated review requests.
Then a unified inbox.
Then 148 more tools.

Today, Vexel Logic is a complete infrastructure platform for UK service businesses.

Not because I'm a tech genius.
Because I'm angry that skill alone isn't enough anymore.

If you're great at what you do but drowning in admin:
That's exactly why I built this.

Let the systems catch what you're too busy to catch.

### POST 4: The Comparison Post

```
HubSpot: £800/month
Vexel: £249/month

Same tools. Different price.

Here's what you get with Vexel's Growth Plan:

✅ Missed Call Bot (instant SMS response)
✅ Review Engine (automated 5-star requests)
✅ Unified Inbox (email, SMS, social in one place)
✅ AI Receptionist (24/7 booking)
✅ Database Reactivator (win back old customers)

All for £249/month.

The HubSpot equivalent? £800+ with add-ons.

But here's the real difference:

We're UK-built, UK-hosted, UK-supported.
No overseas call centres.
No corporate bureaucracy.
No 47-page feature comparison docs.

Just tools that work and humans who answer.

Is HubSpot great? Yes.
Is it built for UK SMEs? No.

We are.

### POST 5: The Industry Callout

```
Plumbers of LinkedIn:

You're probably losing £2,400/month and don't know it.

Here's the uncomfortable math:

Average emergency call: £150-£400
Average installation job: £800-£2,000
Missed calls per week: 5-8 (industry average)

Let's be conservative:
• 6 missed calls/week
• £800 average job value
• 35% close rate

That's £1,680/week in potential jobs.
£6,720/month.
£80,640/year.

You can't answer every call when you're under someone's sink.

But you CAN text back in 30 seconds automatically.

"Hey! Sorry I missed you. I'm on a job till 3pm. What do you need help with?"

That one text recovers 64% of missed calls.

64% of £80k = £51,609/year.

One text. Sent automatically. While you work.

That's infrastructure. That's what we build.

### POST 6: The Quick Win

```
The 30-second fix that recovers £4k/month:

Step 1: Customer calls you
Step 2: You're busy, can't answer
Step 3: Automated text sends instantly:

"Hey! Sorry I missed you. I'm on a job right now. How can I help? - [Your Name]"

That's it.

Results from 50 UK businesses using this:
• 64% of missed calls recovered
• Average of 6 new jobs/month captured
• £3,800-£4,500 in recovered revenue

Total cost: £99/month
Total time to set up: 15 minutes
Total ROI: 39:1

Not complicated.
Not expensive.
Not optional if you're serious about growth.

### Thread 1: The 5 Signs Thread

**Tweet 1/6:**
```
🧵 5 Signs Your Business Is Bleeding Revenue (And Doesn't Know It)

I've audited 50+ UK SMEs.

These are the silent killers I see every time:
```

**Tweet 2/6:**
```
Sign #1: You check your phone "later" for missed calls

Later = never.

By the time you call back, they've already booked your competitor.

Average cost: £800-£2,000 per missed job.
```

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
Sign #2: You're still chasing reviews manually

"Hey, could you leave us a review?"

Nobody does.

Businesses with 4.9★ get 30% more clicks than 4.2★

You're losing visibility while competitors automate this.
```

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
Sign #3: You have 4 different inboxes

• Email
• Facebook messages
• WhatsApp
• Text

You're spending 5-8 hours/week just checking apps.

That's 260+ hours/year on inbox switching.
```

**Tweet 5/6:**
```
Sign #4: You quote in 48 hours

Industry research: quotes delivered within 2 hours have 50% higher close rates.

Every hour you delay = revenue lost.

Sign #5: You think automation is "too expensive"

The £99/mo tool that recovers £4,200/mo isn't expensive.

Doing nothing is.
