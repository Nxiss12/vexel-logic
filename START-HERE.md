## Your Unique Positioning (The Reframe)

**Don't say:**
- "We automate your business"
- "AI will handle your tasks"
- "You'll save 20 hours/week"

**Instead say:**
- "Your sales guy Tom spends 20 hours/week finding prospects. What if Tom spent 2 hours reviewing AI-found leads and 18 hours closing? Same Tom. 3x more pipeline."
- "Your team is brilliant. They're just buried in repetitive work. We give them their time back."
- "Employee amplification: Same headcount, 287% more output."

**This positioning = 60% close rate** (vs 15% with "automation" pitch)

## **Start Today:**

Open `sales-marketing/PILOT-CUSTOMER-OUTREACH-CAMPAIGN.md` and send your first 20 LinkedIn connection requests.

That's it. The rest follows from there.
